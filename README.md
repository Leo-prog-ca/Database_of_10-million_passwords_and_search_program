# Password List Search Tool

Simple Python script that checks whether a password exists in a large text-based database.

This project was created as an early experiment with file handling and large dataset processing.

The script performs a linear search through a newline-separated password list.

Created for learning purposes.

## How it works

The script reads a newline-separated password file and checks whether the given password exists using a linear search.
